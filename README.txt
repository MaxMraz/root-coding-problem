For this problem, I thought it made sense to model the trips as objects, and the drivers as separate objects which held the trips.

In this first iteration, I was unable to configure my computer to bootstrap a project using Spring, like I'm used to.
For that reason, I couldn't set the model up as repositories, and had to do things a bit more simply.
